A Wireless Sensor Network is a collection of multiple sensor nodes which communicate with a gateway or set of gateways to transfer information about their environment.


A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network of distributed sensor nodes which are capable of monitoring their environment through sensors. Because of the various types of sensors that are available, WSNs have a wide ﬁeld of applications, each with their own characteristics and requirements. Although WSN platforms are the subject of constant evolution, most sensor nodes remain reliant on a limited capacity power source. This limitation requires WSN software to be economical with available resources, as applications often require sensor nodes to be located in remote locations, making battery replacement expensive or even impossible.
